## Incident Description

A data processing job was aborted due to a "file not found in the directory" error. The job failed to locate the required input file in the specified directory, causing a delay in the data processing pipeline.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation

1. **Error Logs:** Reviewed the error logs generated by Control-M to identify the cause of the job failure.
2. **Job Configuration:** Examined the job configuration to verify the file path specified for the input file.
3. **File Location:** Checked the directory to confirm the presence of the input file.

### Findings

- The job configuration contained an incorrect file path, pointing to a directory where the input file was not located.
- The input file was placed in a different directory than specified in the job configuration.

## Resolution

1. Identified the correct directory where the input file was located.
2. Updated the job configuration with the correct file path.
3. Restarted the job and monitored its successful completion.

## Preventive Measures

- Implemented additional validation checks in the job configuration to verify the presence of input files before job execution.
- Enhanced monitoring alerts to provide more detailed information about file path errors.

## Lessons Learned

- Accurate file path configuration is critical for the successful execution of data processing jobs.
- Implementing validation checks can help prevent similar issues in the future.

## Recommendations

1. **Validation Checks:** Implement validation checks in the job configuration to verify the presence of input files before job execution.
2. **Monitoring Alerts:** Enhance monitoring alerts to provide detailed information about file path errors.
3. **Training:** Provide training to team members on the importance of accurate file path configuration.
